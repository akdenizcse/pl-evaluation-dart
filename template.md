## History of the language: who/when invented it, which languages influenced it, etc.

Dart is an object-oriented, class-based, garbage-collected language with C-style syntax. Dart can compile to either native code or JavaScript. It supports interfaces, mixins, abstract classes, reified generics and type interfence.

Approved as an Ecma standart(European Computer Manufactures Association), Dart is a general purpose programming language which was created by Google. Its major use is in the creation application for web, servers, mobiles and Internet of Things devices. Dart possesses a BSD(Berkeley Software Distribution) license and an open source software.

Dart has a syntax quite similar to that of C and can transcompile into JavaScript optionally. It is single inheritance, class based and object oriented language. Dart has support for mixins, interfaces, reified generics, optional typing and abstract classes. Dart code runs faster than the same code written in JavaScript. In addition, Dart code can be run directly in some Google Chromium browsers and standalone Software Development Kits to be used in command line interfaces. Dart codes can be compiled into JavaScript have made the language quite compatible with many modern day web browsers.

The GOTO conference took place during 10th-12th  October 2010 at Aarhus, Denmark. It was here that the Dart programming language was revealed for the first time. The Dart project had been initiated by Lars Bak, a Danish programmer famous for his work on virtual machines and contributions to the creation of Google Chrome browsers and Kasper Lund, a software engineer.
